This game was made for the ZenoJam 5 after a friend of mine talked about it.
The game started developement 36 hours before the jam but it took about 12 hours consecutive(as for the release of the mvp)
The game was made with the Godot Game Engine, other tools used were:
- Aseprite
- Soundtrap
- Sfxr

## Ranking
The jam hasn't ended yet so no rating is available

## Gameplay
- Press SPACE to turn off the lights and click the bugs to catch them
- Catching bugs will give you points and catching butterflies will remove them
- Turning the lights off will make the bugs nd butterflies flee.
- Let butterflies flee while catching the bugs, if a bug flees you lose(so don't turn off the lights while there's bugs)
- Reach the score and win
