#### Reading the Code
Please don't, just, don't.
But if you really want to you should download the project and open it with godot and start from the main menu.
The main menu will load a world(World.tscn) which will then load the level(named TestLevel.tscn).
Note that there is a couple of singletons set up in the AutoLoad tab(basically global nodes).
I will not give any other hint as to encourage people to NOT read the code, just know it works
